				<h2><u> About </u></h2>
				<br>
				<p> The goal of UNIfied was to create an intuitive college research tool to simplfy the application process for students and their parents </p>
				<br>
				<p> Designed as a semester-long project, the development of the front-end website required the study of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I had no prior experience with </p>
				<br>
				<p> Due to unique limitations of my web hosting service and time constraints, a simple text document was chosen to hold the college data. This file is generated by the back-end Python web scraper and is loaded by the front-end JavaScript, allowing users to easily search for and compare colleges and prepare for their futures </p>
				<br>
				<p> Of course, the current iteration of UNIfied is only a Minimum Viable Product. Features such as the Chance Me calculator would have likely required several additional months of work and more data than is realistically accessible. Additionally, the comparison table only features the U.S. News Top 20 Schools currently, but this could easily be expanded to encompass every university in the United States, and even schools across the globe. If development were to continue on UNIfied, both the scope and list of features would significantly increase, but the goal of simplicity would remain the guiding design philosophy </p>
